# Problem 7 : Maj


Write a function maj in racket that takes three lists x,y and z of equal length and containing only 0's and 1's. It should return a list containing 1 where two or more of the x y or z values are 1,  and 0 otherwise
For example:
>(maj (list 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1) (list 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1) (list 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1))
'(0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1)
